The main code is in `min_logit_demand.R`. To run the experiment with two risks with different distributions use `source("parameters.R")` and to run the experiment with to risks with different price sensitivities use `source("parameters_diff_demand.R")`.

The functions are in `utils.R`. The function `infinite_survival3` is used to calculate the integro-differential equation governing the ruin probability.
